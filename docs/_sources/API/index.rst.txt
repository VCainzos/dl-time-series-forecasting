dl-time-series-forecasting API
================================

The full public API is delineated below. At this development stage, the **dl-time-series-forecasting** framework
is being designed to facilitate extensibility to other computational packages to the extent possible.

.. note::
    Documented or undocumented attributes, functions, methods, etc.
    named with a leading underscore are **NOT** formally part of the
    API. Their behavior may change without notice.
